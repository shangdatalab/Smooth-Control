# Smooth Control
This is the official data and code implementation of ACL 2024 Findings paper "[Evaluating the Smooth Control of Attribute Intensity in Text Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04460)".


## Data
The constructed benchmark dataset can be found in `./data` folder. For each of the five attributes, we provide 300 different queries that have different potential answers.

## Code
The code implementation is coming soon. Stay tuned!
